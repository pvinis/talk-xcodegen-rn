talk about xcode and xcodegen

xcode is hard, complicated

https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen
xcodegen makes this declarative. imagine project.yml is package.json and xcodeproj is yarn.lock.

- how do i set it up
  - npx react-native init MyProject --version 0.62.0
  - brew install xcodegen
  - we need to create a yml. there is an issue and pr to have this automated, but not yet there. you could grab the template i will make. per version
  - make file
  - maybe a package.json script to run the xcodegen thing?




- how do i use it with upgrades if its not supported

- how do i use it with upgrades if it is supported

- make a PR on react native? also pr for https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen/blob/master/Docs/Examples.md?
