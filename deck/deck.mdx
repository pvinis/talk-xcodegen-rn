`Xcode` is a struggle for many.

Especially coming from `web` or `native Android`.

talk about xcode and xcodegen

xcode is hard, complicated

https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen
xcodegen makes this declarative. imagine project.yml is package.json and xcodeproj is yarn.lock.

- how do i set it up
  - npx react-native init MyProject --version 0.62.0
  - brew install xcodegen
  - we need to create a yml. there is an issue and pr to have this automated, but not yet there. you could grab the template i will make. per version
  https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen/pull/735
  https://github.com/pvinis/react-native-xcodegen
  - make file
  - touch MyProject/main.jsbundle
  - maybe a package.json script to run the xcodegen thing?




- how do i use it with upgrades if its not supported
go to my repo
otherwise check the upgrade-helper xcodeproj diffs


- how do i use it with upgrades if it is supported

- how do i do changes in xcode and save them in yml?

- make a PR on react native? also pr for https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen/blob/master/Docs/Examples.md?

- make a repo react-native-xcodegen and link to the talk repo, list the project.yml for all versions of RN, open issues.
